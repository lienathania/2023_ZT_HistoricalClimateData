## ---9/12---
For now, there are 2 directions that we can try to do:

### 1. Webtool Project
For the webtool project basically the owner of the dataset 林老師 asked us to create a simple web-based tool to explore the dataset. This includes making a simple overall view of the dataset.

Some example links of what the lab already did:
1. Early version of the tool (http://140.122.185.208/~lienathania/HistoricalClimate/climate_tia_ver5.20.11/) Created by: Me
2. Final version of the tool (http://140.122.185.208/~andy0325/climate_new6/) Created by: 安隆

### 2. Continuing Senior 榕宸 Thesis Work
For now what you can do for this is read his thesis work and see if you understand what the whole project is about.

## ---10/15---
We made the decision to continue senior's thesis work. Now the whole idea becomes:
1. Explain what the senior had already made
2. Explain what you think can be improved from what he made
3. Explain that due to the limitation of the platform he uses (Plotly), these improvements cannot be made.
4. Thus, we will need to change his code from the old platform to a new more flexible platform (D3.js).

For step 1,
There are requirements that you need to do to explain his work (or any research work in general):
1. Understand the paper
   - What are the motivation for the study?
   - What is the problem they are trying to solve?
   - Why is it important to use visualization?
2. Understand the code/tool
   - Why he uses the graphs that he use?
   - What kind of information can you gain from the tool?

For step 2,
After you have some understanding of what the author did and why, the next step will be to think logically.
  - Are there any flaw from what he's saying/ his methods?
  - Do you think there are a better way to do what the he's doing? Maybe its not efficient, maybe it doesn't make sense
  - Are there any new methods that would give additional information that he didn't try to do?

For step 3,
After finding problems/things to improve from what the senior already did you have to carefully explain why we need to move platform:
1. Explain what plotly is
2. Explain the limitation of plotly and why it won't work to do what we want to do (plus point if you have proof, maybe you already try and show that yes it won't work in plotly)
3. Explain how D3 can solve your problem

For step 4,
Other than wrapping up the whole idea of what you're going to do in your project, another important thing would be to say about your expected timeline. Set a checkpoint by yourself it can be either every presentation date or every months,weeks.

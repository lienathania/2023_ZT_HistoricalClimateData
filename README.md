## ---9/12---
For now, there are 2 directions that we can try to do:

### 1. Webtool Project
For the webtool project basically the owner of the dataset 林老師 asked us to create a simple web-based tool to explore the dataset. This includes making a simple overall view of the dataset.

Some example links of what the lab already did:
1. Early version of the tool (http://140.122.185.208/~lienathania/HistoricalClimate/climate_tia_ver5.20.11/) Created by: Me
2. Final version of the tool (TBA) Created by: 安隆

### 2. Continuing Senior 榕宸 Thesis Work
For now what you can do for this is read his thesis work and see if you understand what the whole project is about.
